        <h2 class="visuallyhidden">Introduction</h2>

        <p>George F. Ring, my great-grandfather, was born near Rolling Fork, Issaquena County, Mississippi, on 15 January 1867.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p><em>So?</em></p>

        <p>Every family history is full of biographical facts—births, marriages, and deaths; immigrations and migrations; military service and more. Much more than amorphous data floating in a documentary limbo, these facts represent real events that occurred in a real, physical place at a real moment in time. The challenge facing the family historian is to try to personalize the biographical facts of each individual ancestor. How is the birth of George F. Ring <em>different</em> from all the other births in my family tree? What does it <em>mean</em> to be born near Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in 1867? What was the neighborhood like? Was it urban? Rural? Crowded? Noisy? Quiet? Hilly? Swampy? Who were the neighbors? Were they professionals? Craftsmen? Laborers? Foreign-born or American native? How would the dwelling in which this newborn drew his first breath have looked? Was it of brick? Frame? Logs? Sod? Would it have been a second-story flat over the father’s business? A multiple-family tenement—or a multi-columned mansion?</p>

        <p>Answering these questions made it possible for me to “individualize” the birth of this great-grandfather; it also required me to consult a wide variety of sources. In so doing, a methodology took shape for building context around biographical facts. This article retraces my steps and then deduces from those what a workable paradigm might be.</p>

        <h2>The Exercise</h2>

        <section id="the-basic-facts">

          <h3>The Basic Facts</h3>

          <p>My initial document was the 1870 U.S. census of “the Bayou State.” George F. Ring, who is said to be four years old and born in Mississippi, appears in the household of Joseph (born in France) and Barbara (born in New York), with two other male children (the elder born in New York, the younger in Mississippi). All resided in an abode of their own in Schola Precinct of Issaquena County.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Their community was comprised of a handful of well-to-do “planters,” all white, and numerous “farmers” and “laborers,” both white and black. The ratio of blacks to whites in the county was about eight to one; however, in the immediate neighborhood, Rolling Fork, it was fifty to one.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

        </section>
        <section id="documenting-the-birth">

          <h3>Documenting the Birth</h3>

          <p>From research on the family before its removal from New York, I knew that George’s parents had three earlier children (two died as infants). All had been baptized into the Roman Catholic faith—if not on the day of their birth, then a day or so later.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> State and county histories indicate that the closest Roman Catholic church to Issaquena County was St. Paul’s in Vicksburg, forty miles distant as the crow flies and two-and-a-half days’ journey by steamer.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> That is where I found the record of George’s christening, showing that he was born on 15 January 1867 and was baptized—at the age of three and one-half months—on 30 April 1867.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> Granted, the trip downriver would have been strenuous for a newborn. Nevertheless, these parents had waited an uncharacteristically long time to ensure the salvation of their latest offspring’s soul. I suspected there was some reason for the delay other than the voyage itself.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="defining-the-community">

          <h3>Defining the Community</h3>

          <p>Those same state and local histories also explain the distinctive racial composition of George’s environs. Issaquena County lies in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta, a vast, fertile, bottomland of cotton plantations worked before the Civil War by thousands of slaves. After the war, many freedmen remained on the plantations as sharecroppers and wage hands. These the census taker designated <i>laborer</i>. By 1870, however, Issaquena County also had a considerable number of tenant farmers, renting the land they worked, and a few hearty yeomen who actually owned their modest freeholds. These the enumerator labeled <i>farmer</i>. An account of finances, handwritten in 1874 and passed down in the Ring family from generation to generation, shows that George’s father did indeed plant and harvest cotton.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> But on that August day when the census marshal came by with his broad schedules and his pens and his ink, and called Ring a “white farmer,” Joseph possessed no real estate.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="locating-the-parental-residence">

          <h3>Locating the Parental Residence</h3>

          <p>How <em>does</em> a researcher “situate” a backcountry cabin whose inhabitants were renters, not owners? First, I took the Issaquena County land plats of 1873, which are available on microfiche at the Library of Congress,<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="ref" href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> made prints, and taped them together. This provided me with a map showing the major landowners. Then, using the 1870 census, I followed the enumerator on my homemade map as he progressed from planter to planter in Schola Precinct. (The census records a “planter” followed by several pages of “farmers” and “laborers,” then another “planter,” followed by pages of “farmers” and “laborers,” then another “planter,” and so on.) By drawing a line from planter to planter, one by one as the enumerator came to their places, I could identify areas between the planters where the intervening farmers, tenants, and sharecroppers lived. Thus, I pinpointed with some accuracy the physical place where George F. Ring resided in 1870. But was he <em>born</em> there?</p>

          <p>The landless have a tendency to move—a point suggesting I should locate records created closer to George’s birth. The most productive source was the Mississippi state census of 1866, for which Issaquena County was enumerated in November—just eight weeks prior to the crucial date. There, amid the same families who surround them in the 1870 federal census, appear the parents and older brother of George.<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup> In addition, the only two sources known for the birthplace of George’s younger brother, John M. Ring (born June 17, 1869), identify it as “Rolling Fork, Miss.”<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> All in all, the evidence suggests that the Rings did not move between the 1867 birth of George and the 1870 visit from the federal census taker.</p>

          <p>State and county histories corroborate what this mapping exercise reveals: Delta folk lived along waterways. Specifically in Issaquena County, the major thoroughfare was a very long and navigable artery named Deer Creek.<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> Indeed, an 1871 application made by George’s father to purchase a life insurance policy lists his residence as “Deer Creek, Miss.”<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="ref" href="#fn:12">12</a></sup> Now, by superimposing the enumerator’s route on the land plats, I know approximately where on that long, snaking stream the Ring family resided: about four miles down from the hamlet of Rolling Fork.</p>

        </section>
        <section id="visualizing-the-house">

          <h3>Visualizing the House</h3>

          <p>Photographs of the region, taken by the Farm Security Administration during the 1930s, depict the countryside and the hoary dwellings of its people.<sup id="fnref:13"><a class="ref" href="#fn:13">13</a></sup> A far-flung scattering of small cypress cabins pokes out of expansive cotton fields. These, in turn, sprawl from the creek’s edge all the way back to the wavy wall of cottonwoods, cypress, and willows that tower over the sloughs and bayous. Most of these cabins were home to families of poor freedmen. A few housed entrepreneurial whites who had come into the Delta, post Civil-war, from other states and countries. Because every inch of deep, black loam was valuable, cotton stalks would have pushed up as near to the Ring house as the minimum space it takes for a man to turn his mule at the end of a plowed row.</p>

          <p>But what did the Ring house <em>look</em> like? Local histories, community lore, and a few isolated, abandoned, and collapsing cabins from the late-nineteenth century that still dot the cotton fields, all define the traditional style of the Delta cabin.<sup id="fnref:14"><a class="ref" href="#fn:14">14</a></sup> It was built of cypress, available in abundance; its foundation, basically square, rested on blocks. Its four walls were vertical planking, and its pitched roof was weathered shingles. The two gabled sides were shorter than the front and back, because an open gallery—devoid of any railing—fit under the front’s sloping roof.<sup id="fnref:15"><a class="ref" href="#fn:15">15</a></sup> A post at each end of the gallery supported the roof, a window punctuated each wall, and one doorway led inside front and back. Sometimes the interior was divided into two or three rooms by vertical plank partitions, papered with the pages of newspapers if the family had any. A chimney served for both cooking and heating. Few such cabins were whitewashed.</p>

          <p>This is what it meant to be born into a landless family near Rolling Fork, Mississippi, in 1867! But is it possible to say still more about this <em>particular</em> birth of 15 January?</p>

        </section>
        <section id="weathering-the-experience">
          <h3>Weathering the Experience</h3>

          <p>The rhythm of toil and leisure in the Delta, season to season—then, as now— has been dictated by the annual growing cycle of cotton. By the month of January, even the last of picking and ginning would be done. Denuded cotton stalks would rustle and click in the chill winds sweeping across the fields. And those skeletal remnants of the prior year’s crop would not be plowed under until February. All around were dense, deciduous forests—stark and bone-chilling cold, whistling with the breeze on most winter days.<sup id="fnref:16"><a class="ref" href="#fn:16">16</a></sup> So it was a lazy month when George F. Ring was born. Joseph might have been off doing some leisurely hunting when Barbara’s labor pains struck. Or perhaps he whittled out on the gallery to calm his concerns, during the long hours of her delivery, given that the weather on that particular day was atypically mild and pleasant.<sup id="fnref:17"><a class="ref" href="#fn:17">17</a></sup></p>

          <p>However, March 1867 brought disaster: rain, rain, rain. Creeks rose and flowed under the cabins, which stood on their blocks like frogs perched in a pond. Harrowing the fields, to turn the cotton stubble under the soil, was nigh onto impossible in that heavy mud the Deltans called <i>black gum</i>. Then the waters did not recede by mid-April, as they usually did, to allow for sowing; and little of the arable land could be planted.<sup id="fnref:18"><a class="ref" href="#fn:18">18</a></sup> So the infant George F. Ring would have been confined with his mother and brothers to the tight dimensions of their stark shanty by the incessant rain and lingering overflow.</p>

          <p>Here is the reason why his parents waited so dangerously long, in that land of swamps and pestilences, to take him downriver to Vicksburg for baptizing.</p>

      <section id="the-methodology">
        <h2>The Methodology</h2>

        <p>Whether the biographical fact is a birth, such as this example, or a marriage, or a death, or some other life event—or whether it is an immigration from overseas or a migration from Pennsylvania to Nebraska to Idaho—the family historian can often personalize it to appreciate the ancestor as a real person living in a real and physical place at a real moment in time. The method is deceptively simple:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>gather the ancestor’s biographical facts;</li>
          <li>inspect thoughtfully the source for each fact, one fact and source at a time (e.g., in the case of George’s birth, the 1870 census);</li>
          <li>accumulate other sources in any way relating to, or bearing on, the event (e.g., baptismal record, land plats, 1866 census, insurance policy, financial account);</li>
          <li>examine each of these in light of local history—cultural, economic, geographic, political, and social (e.g., state and county histories, oral interviews, historic photographs, scholarly monographs on relevant topics);</li>
          <li>form a hypothesis as to how this real-life event would have transpired;</li>
          <li>test the hypothesis against the contents of all the sources collected; and</li>
          <li>conclude, to the best extent possible, what the past likely was.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This methodology is <em>deceptively</em> simple because the process is often not as linear as <i>one, two, three</i>—and because our efforts to understand the informational content of records created in a place and time very distant and very different from our own are fraught with snares. Nevertheless, only by executing an exercise such as this can we turn statistical facts about an ancestor into experiences that faithfully personalize and humanize the name to which we attach those facts.</p>

        <p id="epilogue">Regarding the birth of my great-grandfather, George F. Ring, this process allowed me to take one set of typically dry, dull facts and poignantly answer the question: <em>So?</em></p>
