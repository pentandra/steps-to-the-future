All around were dense, deciduous\nforests—stark and bone&#45;chilling cold, whistling\nwith the breeze on most winter days.16 So it was a\nlazy month when George F. Ring was born. Joseph\nmight have been off doing some leisurely hunting\nwhen Barbara’s labor pains struck. Or perhaps he\nwhittled out on the gallery to calm his concerns,\nduring the long hours of her delivery, given that\nthe weather on that particular day was atypically\nmild and pleasant.17 \n However, March 1867 brought\ndisaster: rain, rain, rain. Creeks rose and flowed\nunder the cabins, which stood on their blocks like\nfrogs perched in a pond. Harrowing the fields, to\nturn the cotton stubble under the soil, was nigh\nonto impossible in that heavy mud the Deltans\ncalled black gum. Then the waters did not recede\nby mid&#45;April, as they usually did, to allow for\nsowing; and little of the arable land could be\nplanted.18 So the infant George F. Ring would have\nbeen confined with his mother and brothers to the\ntight dimensions of their stark shanty by the\nincessant rain and lingering overflow. \n Here is the reason why his parents waited\nso dangerously long, in that land of swamps and\npestilences, to take him downriver to Vicksburg\nfor baptizing. \n&quot;</title>

<!-- &quot;How does a researcher “situate” a\nbackcountry cabin whose inhabitants were renters,\nnot owners?

This provided me\nwith a map showing the major landowners. Then,\nusing the 1870 census, I followed the enumerator\non my homemade map as he progressed from planter\nto planter in Schola Precinct. (The census records\na “planter” followed by several pages of “farmers”\nand “laborers,” then another “planter,” followed\nby pages of “farmers” and “laborers,” then another\n“planter,” and so on.) By drawing a line from\nplanter to planter, one by one as the enumerator\ncame to their places, I could identify areas\nbetween the planters where the intervening\nfarmers, tenants, and sharecroppers lived. Thus, I\npinpointed with some accuracy the physical place\nwhere George F. Ring resided in 1870. But was he\nborn there? The landless have a\ntendency to move—a point suggesting I should\nlocate records created closer to George’s birth.\nThe most productive source was the Mississippi\nstate census of 1866, for which Issaquena County\nwas enumerated in November—just eight weeks prior\nto the crucial date.

State and county\nhistories corroborate what this mapping exercise\nreveals: Delta folk lived along waterways.\nSpecifically in Issaquena County, the major\nthoroughfare was a very long and navigable artery\nnamed Deer Creek.11 Indeed, an 1871 application\nmade by George’s father to purchase a life\ninsurance policy lists his residence as “Deer\nCreek, Miss.”12 Now, by superimposing the\nenumerator’s route on the land plats, I know\napproximately where on that long, snaking stream\nthe Ring family resided: about four miles down\nfrom the hamlet of Rolling Fork.&quot; -->

<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1628" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">&quot;How does a researcher “situate” a</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1615" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">backcountry cabin whose inhabitants were renters,</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1602" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">not owners? First, I took the Issaquena County</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1589" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">land plats of 1873, which are available on</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1576" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">microfiche at the Library of Congress,8 made</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1563" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">prints, and taped them together. This provided me</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1550" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">with a map showing the major landowners. Then,</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1537" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">using the 1870 census, I followed the enumerator</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1524" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">on my homemade map as he progressed from planter</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1511" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">to planter in Schola Precinct. (The census records</text>

<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1407" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">farmers, tenants, and sharecroppers lived. Thus, I</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1394" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">pinpointed with some accuracy the physical place</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1381" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">where George F. Ring resided in 1870. But was he</text>

<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1329" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">The most productive source was the Mississippi</text>

<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1212" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">Fork, Miss.”10 All in all, the evidence suggests</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1199" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">that the Rings did not move between the 1867 birth</text>

<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1134" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">Specifically in Issaquena County, the major</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1121" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">thoroughfare was a very long and navigable artery</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1108" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">named Deer Creek.11 Indeed, an 1871 application</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1095" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">made by George’s father to purchase a life</text>
<text text-anchor="middle" x="4861" y="-1082" style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:10.00px;">insurance policy lists his residence as “Deer</text>
